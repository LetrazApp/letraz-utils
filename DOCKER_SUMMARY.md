# Docker Containerization Summary

## Overview
The Letraz Job Scraper application has been successfully containerized for production deployment. The Docker setup includes multi-stage builds, security best practices, and comprehensive deployment documentation.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Docker Infrastructure Created
- **Dockerfile**: Production-ready multi-stage build
- **docker-compose.prod.yml**: Production Docker Compose configuration
- **.dockerignore**: Optimized build context exclusions
- **env.template**: Environment variable template for easy setup
- **DEPLOYMENT.md**: Comprehensive deployment guide

### 2. Docker Image Features
- **Multi-stage build**: Separate build and runtime stages for minimal image size
- **Security**: Non-root user execution
- **Browser support**: Chromium browser for headed scraping
- **Health checks**: Built-in health monitoring
- **Optimized size**: ~1.13GB final image with all dependencies

### 3. Production-Ready Features
- **Resource limits**: Memory and CPU constraints
- **Logging**: Structured JSON logging with rotation
- **Restart policies**: Automatic container restart on failure
- **Environment configuration**: Comprehensive environment variable support
- **Health monitoring**: Multiple health check endpoints

### 4. Deployment Options
- **Single container**: Direct Docker run with environment files
- **Docker Compose**: Orchestrated deployment with resource management
- **Scaling**: Horizontal scaling support for load balancing

## Architecture Components Containerized

### Core Service Components
1. **API Layer**: Echo-based REST API with middleware
2. **Worker Pool**: Concurrent job processing system
3. **Scraper Engines**: 
   - Hybrid (Rod + Firecrawl fallback)
   - Firecrawl API integration
   - Rod browser automation
4. **LLM Integration**: Claude API for job data extraction
5. **Rate Limiting**: Domain-specific rate limiting with circuit breaker

### External Dependencies
- **Chromium Browser**: For headed scraping functionality
- **Go Runtime**: Optimized Go 1.23 runtime
- **SSL Certificates**: For HTTPS communications
- **Time Zone Data**: For proper timestamp handling

## Key Configuration Areas

### Required Environment Variables
- `LLM_API_KEY`: Claude API key for job data extraction
- `CAPTCHA_API_KEY`: 2captcha API key for captcha solving
- `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`: Firecrawl API key for web scraping

### Performance Tuning
- `WORKER_POOL_SIZE`: Number of concurrent workers (default: 10, production: 20)
- `WORKER_QUEUE_SIZE`: Job queue capacity (default: 100, production: 200)
- `WORKER_RATE_LIMIT`: Requests per minute per domain (default: 60, production: 120)

### Resource Allocation
- **Memory**: 1GB reserved, 2GB limit (configurable)
- **CPU**: 1.0 reserved, 2.0 limit (configurable)
- **Disk**: Minimal, primarily for logs and temporary files

## Deployment Verification

### Tests Performed
1. **Docker Build**: Successfully built image (1.13GB)
2. **Container Startup**: Verified successful initialization
3. **Health Checks**: Confirmed health endpoint responses
4. **Worker Pool**: Verified worker statistics endpoint
5. **API Endpoints**: Confirmed all API endpoints are accessible

### Performance Metrics
- **Build Time**: ~102 seconds (includes dependency downloads)
- **Startup Time**: ~5 seconds to healthy state
- **Memory Usage**: ~100MB baseline (without active jobs)
- **Image Size**: 1.13GB (includes Chromium browser)

## Enhanced Makefile Commands

New Docker-related commands added:
- `make docker-build`: Build Docker image
- `make docker-run`: Run container with environment file
- `make docker-run-prod`: Run production container with resource limits
- `make docker-stop`: Stop and remove production container
- `make docker-logs`: View container logs
- `make docker-shell`: Open shell in running container
- `make docker-clean`: Clean Docker images and containers

## Security Considerations Implemented

1. **Non-root execution**: Container runs as user `scrapper` (UID 1001)
2. **Minimal base image**: Alpine Linux for reduced attack surface
3. **No secrets in image**: All API keys via environment variables
4. **Resource limits**: Prevents resource exhaustion attacks
5. **Health checks**: Enables monitoring and automatic recovery

## Deployment-Ready Features

### Monitoring
- Health check endpoints for container orchestration
- Comprehensive worker pool statistics
- Request tracing with unique request IDs
- Structured logging with configurable levels

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling support via Docker Compose
- Load balancer compatibility
- Resource-aware configuration
- Independent service architecture

### Maintenance
- Log rotation and management
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Container restart policies
- Easy configuration updates

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Set up environment variables** with actual API keys
2. **Configure reverse proxy** (nginx/traefik) for SSL termination
3. **Set up monitoring** (Prometheus/Grafana) for metrics collection
4. **Configure log aggregation** (ELK stack) for centralized logging
5. **Implement CI/CD pipeline** for automated deployments
6. **Set up backup strategy** for configuration and logs

The application is now fully containerized and ready for production deployment with enterprise-grade features and monitoring capabilities.
